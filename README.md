A simple 3D printed solder fumes extractor

Link to my blog: http://niutonian.com/wavy-fume-extractor

** Update: New feet design, I changed the angle of the feet to make them stand better on the side. 


The fume extractor was printed using PLA Filament make sure to put all the files on their flat side.
Support is needed for the "FANMOUNT_HOOD.stl" and "FANMOUNT_BOTTOM.stl" files.
